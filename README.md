OpenRx uses OpenClaw as its AI backbone with 12 specialized agents:

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| Onboarding | New patient setup, profile and care-team orchestration |
| Coordinator | Routes patient messages to the right specialist |
| Triage | After-hours symptom assessment and urgency classification |
| Scheduling | Insurance-aware booking, reminders, no-show follow-up |
| Billing | Claims error detection, appeal generation, revenue optimization |
| Rx Manager | Adherence monitoring, refill reminders, pharmacy coordination |
| PA Agent | Prior auth form filling, criteria matching, ePA submission |
| Wellness | Preventive care plans and screening follow-through |
| Screening | Risk stratification and preventive screening prioritization |
| Second Opinion | Structured care-plan review and clinician question prep |
| Clinical Trials | Trial matching and enrollment-fit guidance |
| DevOps | Deployments, health checks, and self-improvement pipeline |

10 automated cron jobs handle reminders, adherence checks, follow-ups, and platform health checks.

## Live API Integrations

- **NPI Registry (NPPES)** — Real-time provider search by city, ZIP, specialty, or name. Free CMS API, no key needed.
- **NPI Registry (Organizations)** — Natural-language pharmacy finder with location validation.
- **Base Account (`@base-org/account`)** — Server-side Base Pay status verification for payment settlement controls.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## OpenClaw Gateway (optional)

To connect the live AI gateway:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

Create `.env.local`:

```env
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:18789
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

The app detects gateway availability automatically and reports live/offline status in the UI.
